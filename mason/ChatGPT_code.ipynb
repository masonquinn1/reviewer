        "test_reviews = \"I've had a chance to use this pack now that parks have opened in my area, while I still like the idea of having a lightweight pack-able backpack for day hikes, you must keep in mind that this has 'zero-padding'. The issues I have found with mine aside for there being no padding on the straps or back, is that the bottom of the pack is not protected as it has the same fabric as the rest of the pack, so therefore be cautious where you sit it down. Another issue I discovered: IT IS NOT WATERPROOF, and is barely water resistant. If you get caught in any level of moderate rain fall, the contents of your pack will be soaked. I found this out very quickly one afternoon when a storm crept up on us without warning. The zipper on mine is failing as it gets caught every time you try to close it due the the zipper flap and the threads are unraveling. Overall, I still like that is is extremely lightweight and useful. I advise you to spray it with a waterproofing spray before venturing out and suggest that the manufacturers at least use a more durable material on the bottom. Can't do much about the padding since it won't fit back in it's case, but despite these two issues. I still think it a great buy 'under $20'. I haven't contacted the seller for warranty service for the main zipper, hopefully they'll reach out if they are interested in my feedback, otherwise I will probably buy another version once the zipper fails completely (hopefully not while I'm out on a trail). I love all of the little pockets and features. It’s exactly what I needed in a daypack. Seems to be well made. I would buy again. I’ve had my first Total PAC for 3 years and used it daily as a pack to go to and from work regularly. The size and weight are worth the price alone. It can hold pretty much everything you need with you. This pack made it through countless fishing trips, a 2 week junket through the rugged Alaska tundra along with a trip to jolly ol’ England. It runs pretty lightweight for a pack but using it for touring, it’s pretty functional. I has a lot of pockets for small items as well as side straps to hold bottles. It also has a USB charge port built into the side which allows you to keep your battery pack in the bag and secure while you charge devices from the outside. I’ve only used this a few times but it works just fine. It folds into itself to make it about a 6'x6' square for easy travel. After 3 years of constant use the stitching on the top began to come undone. I bought my second one in blue for a change and hopefully get as much use out of it as the first one. When you go camp in sun and orange color bright classy, best style bag I would say is. i love classy bright orange that matches with sun color and this product was close to that. I used to take my office laptop bag when going for hiking. Laptop bag itself is about 2 lb so I was looking for something light that can carry essential things for hiking. I found this bag and it is very light and can carry a lot of things which you may need. Would for sure recommend it. How many pockets in this foldable backpack? 10! I tried to show them in the pictures. I love the clip in the front to hold the shoulder straps in place. There are two ways to remove the USB cord. One is to realize that the plastic is kind of soft and there's nothing on the inside holding it in place, so pushing inward/side way will dislodge it. The other way is to thread your finger inside, aim between the wire and the housing, it'll also give this way. I was also able to thread another magnetic USB wire through cuz that's what I usually use. I like this backpack a lot. In case they discontinue it, I've bought myself one of each color. I bought this for my husband as he needed a larger bag for work. The bag is a reasonable quality, but it is far from the listed capacity! If you’re looking for a larger backpack, be advised that this pack is only a fraction of the described size. This pack is advertised as a 35 L, as you can see beside my DEUTER 28 L, which is comfortably full and so is the Total Pac. This may be and 18 maybe a 20 definitely not a 35 even close. I was pleased with the quality but as in sleeping bags coldness ratings are not standardize but the Liter size in packs is… Even if it was off this is a big miss. I'm sure this would be fine for a travel item or something casual, but I used this as a gear bag for a weekend. It's super thin, and I put two (small) holes in it the first time I used it. There is no padding in the back so you feel every lump and poke in it. I was carrying hard metal gear and had to be really careful with how I packed it, so I wasn't being stabbed in the back. The USB port is an impractical feature and extra weight for hikers, and they replaced the more standard hole for a water tube with the USB port. This looks and is advertised like a product for adventures, but should not be used beyond a casual extra bag. I used this for a month and ended up buying a different pack. The material is super light but the down side to it is it collapses wile trying to put things into it. Also the zippers get constantly stuck on the flaps designed to protect them from who knows what.\"\n",
